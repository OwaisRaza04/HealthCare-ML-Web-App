<h1>HealthCare ML Web App</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Welcome to the HealthCare ML Web App! This application leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to provide various health-related predictions, including disease diagnosis and early detection. Users can input symptoms, demographic information, or medical data, and the model will generate predictions for diseases like diabetes, liver diseases, malaria, and pneumonia.
